This is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

If you're looking for something interactive, check out my Shiny app [here](https://colin-sanders.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/).

Do you have questions? feel free to [open an issue][issue] or find out how toreach me from my [contact page][contact].


For more details about how this example site works checkout [the github project](https://github.com/jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter).


Have a great day!!
