#### As we draw closer to the beginning of the 2024 college baseball season, I want to share a model that I have been working on for the past few months. It's a power rating* model that evaluates teams using a number of offensive and defensive statistics. The goal when creating this model was to accurately assess the strength of college baseball teams over the course of the whole season, in an effort to predict who will lift the national championship trophy at the end of the year and to compare teams across different seasons. 

#### This model has been set up to be interpreted in two ways. The first is as a win projection tool. The formula the model uses will produced a number of expected wins based on their performance throughout the year. I prefer to use it as a power rating system, where the projected wins represent each teams strength compared to the others.







*These are NOT rankings. The model does not know who you played or what the score was. This decision was made in an effort to peel back the layers and evaluate how good each team truly is. Results can be misleading, so they are not included in the calculations.
